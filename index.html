      <h1>Aviation Accident Analysis</hi>  
    </div>
    
    <p>Plane crashes typically make very memorable, serious headlines. Reading about the number of victims affected by plane accidents is heartbreaking. Just recently, 
    the small plane crash in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota occurred in which a plane with one person crashed straight into a suburban house. Thankfully, no one in the home 
    was hurt but there were no surviviors in the plane. Upon impact, the plane quickly set ablaze. Some of these crashes can't help but make you think,
    what on Earth caused such an event? Are these plane crashes becoming more and more common?</p>
    <p>
      These are the type of questions that led me to exploring real data and reports about aviation accidents. There will be visualizations analyzing short-term information 
      (last five years) and some longer-term visualizations starting from 1982.

    <h2>The Data</h2>
    All of the data used comes from the National Transportation Safety Board's Case Analysis and Reports.
    I only used data from 1982 - 2024, but similar data ia available back to 1962. NTSB organizes a wide variety of aviation events and crafts, including lower-level incidents, 
    helicopters, and unmanned drones. However, to focus the scope of this investigation, all of my data derives from events including one or more airplanes that were classified as "accidents"
    (more serious events in which the plane was damaged or lives were threatened/harmed).

    
    <h2>Time</h2>

      As you can see, the amount of plane accidents have severely decreased in the last 43 years. One notable dip in accidents was in 2020, when many flights - especially international flights -
      were temporarily banned and people were required to social distance. One piece of data I would love to further this graph would be on the overall number of flights every year. I am not sure how and
      where one could obtain information on every private flight and commerical flight taken place in the United States. However, I think that could add a lot to this visualization as it seems there is
      greater demand for flights and it seems more people are flying. If that would be the case, then percentages of how many accidents occur against how many flights occur could be calculuated. Then, people
      could understand the ratio of actual accidents which I would predict is lower than it feels when we watch the news about all these plane crashes.

    <p>
      While the data did contain latitudes and longitudes of most aviation accidents, unfortunately many data points were collected in differing formats. It seemed like enough of the
      accidents worldwide were disordered in which I could not trust the location of a significant portion of accidents. There were too many data points to reformat and too many ways to reformat them (believe me, I tried).
      However, since the state and city location of the accidents remained accurate, there is still something that can be gained in viewing where accidents occurred in the United States. The four states that 
      immediately stand out with high counts of accidents are California, Texas, Florida and Alaska. California, Texas, and FLorida all have higher state populations, so it is not surprising that they each have 
      higher accidetn counts. However, if we apply this same population logic, some of the states on the East coast like New York and Pennsylvania should have equally high rates. Nevertheless, no state in the East has high rates of accidetns by any means. I am especially shocked New York
      does not have more accidents knowing their high population and two busy airports (John F. Kennedy and Newark). Not many people live in Alaska and they have a very low population density. I wonder if their high
      accident count could have to do with the weather and environment.
