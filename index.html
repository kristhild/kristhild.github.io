      <h1>Aviation Accident Analysis</hi>  
    </div>
    
    <p>It is always scary when you see a burning ball engulfing a large yet now seemingly small plane on the news.
    In the worst cases of aviation accidents, you sit and listen as the newscasters list off the fatalities of people who were
    not expecting to pass that day. Crashes </p>

    <h2>The Data</h2>
    All of the data used comes from the National Transportation Safety Board's Case Analysis and Reports.
    I only used data from 1982 - 2024, but similar data ia available back to 1962. NTSB organizes a wide variety of aviation events and crafts, including lower-level incidents, 
    helicopters, and unmanned drones. However, to focus the scope of this investigation, all of my data derives from events including one or more airplanes that were classified as "accidents"
    (more serious events in which the plane was damaged or lives were threatened/harmed).
